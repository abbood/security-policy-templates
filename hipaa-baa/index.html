<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This document includes sample business associate agreement provisions to help
covered entities and business associates more easily comply with the business
associate contract requirements. This sample is created by Office for Civil
Rights (OCR), available online at the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/sample-business-associate-agreement-provisions/index.html">HHS website</a>.</p>
<p>While these sample provisions are written for
the purposes of the contract between a covered entity and its business
associate, the language may be adapted for purposes of the contract between a
business associate and subcontractor.</p>
<p>This is only sample language and use of these sample provisions is not required
for compliance with the HIPAA Rules.  The language may be changed to more
accurately reflect business arrangements between a covered entity and business
associate or business associate and subcontractor.  In addition, these or
similar provisions may be incorporated into an agreement for the provision of
services between a covered entity and business associate or business associate
and subcontractor, or they may be incorporated into a separate business
associate agreement. These provisions address only concepts and requirements set
forth in the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach Notification, and Enforcement
Rules, and alone may not be sufficient to result in a binding contract under
State law. They do not include many formalities and substantive provisions that
may be required or typically included in a valid contract.  Reliance on this
sample may not be sufficient for compliance with State law, and does not replace
consultation with a lawyer or negotiations between the parties to the contract.</p>
