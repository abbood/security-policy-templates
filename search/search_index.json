No persistent users, passwords or access keys are allowed in AWS IAM configurations for end-user access, either to the AWS console or AWS CLI. This is achieved with the following processes:</p> <p>AWS Console Access</p> <ul> <li>An organization master account (<code>rovera-master</code>) in AWS is configured with   IAM roles such as Developer and Security.</li> <li>SAML SSO and trust relationship is established between the roles in   <code>rovera-master</code> and an \u201cAWS application\u201d provisioned in Okta.</li> <li>Users are assigned their corresponding roles through application and role   assignment in Okta.</li> <li>Via SSO, Users authenticate through Okta by using their Okta username,   password, and MFA.</li> <li>Upon successful authentication and MFA validation, users are logged into   <code>rovera-master</code> using AWS Assume Role capability.</li> <li>The roles in <code>rovera-master</code> by default has highly restricted access. For   example, the <code>Developer</code> role does not have access to any services and   resources in the master account.</li> <li>The user is required to Assume a Role in a sub-account, connected via   cross-account trust policy defined at account bootstrap or through an approved   change management process.  For example, a Developer can assume the   <code>Administrator</code> role in <code>rovera-dev</code>, which is the sandboxed development   environment in a separate AWS account.</li> <li> <p>Assume Role access to a production AWS account is highly restricted.</p> <ul> <li>Developers can only assume the <code>Developer</code> role in production which only   has access to read CloudWatch logs, XRay system traces/service maps,   CloudWatch metrics, resource group inventories, and CloudWatch dashboards.</li> <li>Security can only assume the <code>Auditor</code> role in production which has the   default Auditor IAM policy managed by AWS.  This policy allows read-only   access to account and resource configurations, but does not allow read   access to any data such as S3 objects.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>AWS CLI/SDK Access</p> <ul> <li>Okta AWS-CLI Tool   is used to obtain temporary credentials (access keys) for developers to   connect to AWS using the CLI or SDK.</li> <li>By running the Okta AWS-CLI Tool, developers are prompted to authenticate to   Okta using their Okta credentials and MFA token/app.</li> <li>Upon successful authentication and MFA validation, a temporary access key and   session token is inserted into the local configuration file (e.g.   <code>~/.aws/credentials</code> and <code>~/.aws/config</code>).</li> <li>This temporary credentials expires after one hour and a new temporary   credential must be obtained for access.</li> <li>Through this method, developers are granted the same permission as they would   by assuming the <code>Developer</code> role through AWS console.</li> <li>Additional details are documented on the Development Wiki.</li> </ul> <p>IAM Safety</p> <ul> <li>rovera implements Dome9 to monitor and protect its AWS environments.   Dome9 provides an additional layer of defense on top of native IAM policies   called IAM Safety.</li> <li>IAM Safety works by defining a set of risky actions, such as adding/remove IAM   users to an Explicit Deny policy.  The policy is attached to an IAM Group,   and protected Users and/or Roles are assigned to this Group.</li> <li>Because explicit deny rules always take precedence in AWS IAM policy, this   effectively restricts access and prohibits execution of the risky actions as   defined in the policy, even if the user/role may have administrative   privilege.</li> <li>Original access can be temporarily restored through the Dome9 web console or   its mobile app.</li> <li>Privilege Roles, such as Security role in master account and Administrator   role in production account, are protected by IAM Safety.</li> <li>Additional details can be found on Dome9\u2019s product   documentation.</li> </ul> <p>Troubleshooting / Support Access</p> <p>In normal operations, troubleshooting is performed with log analysis in Sumo Logic, outside of the production environments in AWS. A separate Support role is created for temporary troubleshooting and support access when log access is insufficient to determine the cause. Support access should be minimized and is designed to involve manual approval and provision process.</p> <ul> <li>The Support role by default is NOT assigned to anyone.</li> <li>The Support role is configured with Read level access to the services used by   rovera platform services and applications.  It does NOT have permission to   make any configuration changes and does NOT have access to production data.</li> <li>A PRODCM ticket is used to request temporary support access and must be   approved by Head of Engineering and Security.</li> <li>Upon approval of the support access PRODCM ticket, Security grants the   requestor temporary access to by assigning the Support role to that particular   individual user in Okta.</li> <li>The Support role is protected by Dome9 with IAM Safety and it must be   explicitly allowed by the Security team for it to assume the Support role in   the target production environment.</li> <li>By default, temporary Support access is limited to one hour.
